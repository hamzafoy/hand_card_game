### What is this app?

*Hand* is a variant of the card game *Rummy* that my father-in-law taught me. In ode to his Palestinian & Jordanian roots, I decided to develop this app
to demonstrate my ability both with JavaScript logic & with working with the React library.

**My intention** with this application is to serve a multiplayer version of Hand that will hopefully allow up to 4 players to play at the same time.
