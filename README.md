### What is this app?

This is a very simplified version of **Hand**, a Jordanian card game.

In order to play, you must click `Start Game`, then discard a card & add a card to your set.
To end your turn, click `End Turn`. To play the *computer's turn*, click `Computer's Turn`.
The computer's turn is quick, then it is your turn again in which case you must discard a card & add a card to your set. Repeat this cycle until you or the computer gets **51 points**.

This app is only intended for the desktop/laptop/monitor viewports.

<!-- ### Scratchpad regarding game logic

In *Hand*, each player is given **14 cards** with one player (this alternates) given an extra card.
The player who received the extra card **must discard a card only to start the game**.
After the game starts, each turn **must consist** of. . .

1. Drawing one card
2. Organizing their hand into sets
3. Playing a full hand* or laying down cards equivalent to **51** points<br>
*a hand consists of all sets in addition to the card that they must discard to end their turn.
4. Lastly, discarding one card

#### A set can be composed as follows. . .
- 3 or more cards, of the same suit, in order*<br>
*Ex: A, 2, 3 - 3, 4, 5, 6 - 10, J, Q, K, A
- 3 or more cards, of different suits, of the same number or symbol

#### A wildcard is. . .
The `A` of a pre-determined suit in the beginning of the game. This wildcard can be used in place of any card you may not have*<br>
*Ex: You have a 6 [&spades;] & a 8 [&spades;] & a wildcard. That wildcard can be used as a 7 [&spades;] to complete a set. -->
